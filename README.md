# Fantasy Football API Scraping

Google Apps Script functions for various platforms and functions for Fantasy Football league and player data.


Currently I've only shared the following function here, but hope to add more:

fantasy_football_api_scraping/sleeper/sleeperPlayerImport.js

 - Open the Google 'Extensions' menu in a spreadsheet
 - Select 'Apps Script'
 - Create a new script and paste the code into the box
 - Run the script (will prompt for security, click on 'review permissions' > 'select account' > 'advanced' > 'proceed' > 'allow'
 - Player table will be created with all rostered (on NFL teams) players and positions that are in the 'positions' array of the code, which defaults to ['QB','RB','FB','WR','TE','K','DEF']


Thanks for checking it out!
